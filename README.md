# tabbycat-importers
Team and judge importers for BP tournaments using the Tabbycat API. We used this to set up the tab page for the Luzon Intervarsity 2021.

If you are unfamiliar with Python and wish to use this for your tournament your data spreadsheet MUST follow the template given by tab_database.xlsx.

* S1 / S2 = Name of Speaker 1 / Speaker 2
* E1 / E2 = Email of Speaker 1 / Speaker 2
* N1 / N2 = Novice status of Speaker 1 / Speaker 2

Code is based on Tasdid's work, but allows for importing novice status and institution code. If I have the time I may work on a clash importer as well.
